## üéì ScholarNest

**ScholarNest** is a decentralized platform that empowers students by enabling crypto-backed educational funding through smart contracts on the blockchain.

Built on the Aptos network using the Move programming language, ScholarNest connects students and donors transparently. Donors can fund students directly using the native **ScholarNestToken**, and smart contracts ensure that funds are released based on academic milestones.

### ‚ú® Key Highlights:

* ‚úÖ Smart contract‚Äìdriven scholarship disbursement
* üîê Transparent and traceable donations via blockchain
* üéØ Funding linked to academic performance and milestones
* üåç Accessible globally for both students and donors

ScholarNest's mission is to **eliminate financial barriers to education** and create a trustless, open ecosystem where education meets Web3.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
